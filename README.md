# About
This is a silly project. Don't take it seriously.
# Changelog
Version numbers are as follows: vx.y
v = version type (alpha beta and stuff)
x = when there are new features, this number increases and resets y to 0
y = changes are made but are insignificant (Bug fixes)
## Alpha versions
Alpha versions are versions of this project where the actual project is unusable. Most of the alpha versions will just be experiments.
### Alpha 1.0 (20 June 2024)
 - Yippee Window (opens a 960 by 540 px window which closes when the X button is pressed)
### Alpha 1.1 (20 June 2024)
 - Added "README.md"
### Alpha 1.2 (20 June 2024)
 - Added "Old versions" folder in anticipations of keeping old verisons for fun (its empty now so it doesn't show up)
